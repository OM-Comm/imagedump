              <h4>Bitcoin Futures Trading Volume Increases Amid Price Decline</h4>
Futures trading volume increased by 12% over the past 24 hours, indicating rising institutional interest in derivatives, despite Bitcoin's decline to $110,530. Whale transactions involving 450 BTC worth approximately $4.0 million continue to exert downward pressure. Additionally, altcoin open interest surged by 150% during the same period, coinciding with a 7.8% drop in Bitcoin’s price, suggesting heightened speculative activity and potential volatility.

<h4>Bitcoin Liquidations Reach Nearly $940 Million Following Market Decline</h4>
Bitcoin has fallen approximately 7%, trading around $109,500 after peaking above $117,000, resulting in nearly $940 million in liquidations within 24 hours, with $800 million stemming from long positions. This decline has caused Bitcoin to drop below the $110,000 support level, indicating increased bearish sentiment. The market cap declined by over 4%, and Bitcoin has struggled to recover amid thin liquidity and ETF outflows.

<h4>MicroStrategy Expands Bitcoin Holdings with $356.9 Million Purchase</h4>
MicroStrategy has increased its Bitcoin holdings by purchasing 3,081 BTC for $356.9 million at an average price of $115,800 per BTC, boosting its total holdings to 632,457 BTC. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's price is currently testing the $112,398 support level following a $2.7 billion liquidation event involving 24,000 BTC across major exchanges, triggered by a whale selloff amid ongoing market volatility and bearish sentiment.

<h4>Regulatory Developments Impacting Institutional Interest in Crypto</h4>
Kraken engaged in discussions with the US SEC regarding its plans to tokenize traditional assets, indicating progress toward regulatory clarity for tokenized securities. Meanwhile, Canary Capital has filed an application for an ‘American-Made’ crypto ETF focused on tracking an index of digital assets with American origins, amidst ongoing SEC delays in approving other crypto ETF proposals. Grayscale has submitted an S-1 registration statement to the SEC to convert its Avalanche (AVAX) Trust into a spot ETF, which would enable trading on Nasdaq.

              <h4>$900M Liquidations Hit ETH, BTC; Market Faces Sharp Corrections</h4>
In August 2025, the crypto market experienced over $900 million in liquidations, with ETH accounting for $320 million, Bitcoin $277 million, and Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin combined totaling $90 million. During this period, ETH's price declined from $4,700 to $4,400, while Bitcoin dropped to $110,200. Following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s dovish remarks, Bitcoin retraced to $110,000, down from recent highs, with a 3% decline over 24 hours. This prompted a liquidity shift from Bitcoin into altcoins such as Ethereum and Solana.

<h4>Solana Treasury Expansion Sparks 70% Surge in Sharps Tech Shares</h4>
Shares of Nasdaq-listed Sharps Technology (STSS) surged by as much as 70%, briefly surpassing $13, representing a 53% increase from last Friday’s close of $7.3. This rally followed the announcement of a $400 million fundraising effort aimed at establishing a Solana treasury. The company plans to allocate the funds primarily toward acquiring SOL tokens, with shares sold at $6.50 per unit and warrants exercisable at $9.75. Additionally, the Solana Foundation committed to selling $50 million in SOL at a 15% discount to further support the project’s expansion.

<h4>Bitcoin Falls 7% to $109.5K After Powell Dovish Tone</h4>
Bitcoin has fallen approximately 7%, trading around $109,500 after peaking above $117,000, following Federal Reserve Chair Powell’s dovish tone at Jackson Hole. This decline has caused Bitcoin to drop below the $110,000 support level, resulting in nearly $940 million in liquidations within 24 hours, with $800 million stemming from long positions. Meanwhile, Ethereum briefly surged to $4,900 before sharply reversing and now hovers above $4,300.
